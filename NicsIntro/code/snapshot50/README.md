D3 linear scale
 * Transform numbers from data space into pixel space
 * d3.scale.linear() is a function that creates a new instance of that scale which you can set properties on (domain and range)
 * See [D3 Quantitative Scales documentation](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Quantitative-Scales)

## What if we flipped the range? [100, 0]
