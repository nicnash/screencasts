Functions in variables

 * Instead of passing in a string, we are passing in a function
 * [Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions) are first class objects in JS
 * Have properties and methods just like any other object. What distinguishes them from other objects is that functions can be called. In brief, they are Function objects.
